//Given a positive integer n, find its square root. If n is not a perfect square, then return floor of âˆšn.

//Examples : 

//Input: n = 4
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2.

//Input: n = 11
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The square root of 11 lies in between 3 and 4 so floor of the square root is 3.
